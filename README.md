# 📘 DSA Tracker – My MAANG Journey

Hi, I'm Manish – a Computer Engineering student on a mission to crack a ₹20+ LPA job at a MAANG company.

This repository is my **daily log of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice. I'm using this to:
- Stay consistent
- Track progress
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews
